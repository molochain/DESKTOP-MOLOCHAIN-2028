All subdomain migration tasks are complete! Here's the summary of what's been accomplished: **Completed Infrastructure:** - ✅ Main site: https://molochain.com - ✅ Admin portal: https://admin.molochain.com - ✅ App portal: https://app.molochain.com **SSO Configuration:** - Session cookies use `.molochain.com` domain in production, enabling cross-subdomain authentication - Cookie name: `logistics.sid` - CORS origins configured for all subdomains - Logout on any subdomain revokes all refresh tokens for the user **How to Test SSO:** 1. Login on any subdomain (e.g., molochain.com) 2. Navigate to another subdomain (e.g., admin.molochain.com) - you should remain logged in 3. Logout on any subdomain - should log you out everywhere **Deployment Options:** Your app is currently running on your VPS (31.186.24.19) via PM2. You can also publish it through Replit's deployment feature if you want a separate hosted version. Would you like to proceed with publishing to Replit?

Let me investigate the authentication issue and check the admin pages structure. The logs show a login loop where login succeeds but subsequent auth checks fail.
