Analysis of External Report
I've compared the external report with our actual codebase and production server. Here's my assessment:

Accurate Information
Claim	Verification	Status
Container ports (7000, 8080, 5001, 6379, 1337)	Matches production	Correct
auth.molochain.com has wrong build	Confirmed issue	Correct
Health monitor script exists	Found at /scripts/container-health-monitor.sh	Correct
auth-service location	/var/www/vhosts/molochain.com/OTMS-DOCKER/auth-service/ exists	Correct
Redis on 172.22.0.2:6379	Used for sessions	Correct
CORS configuration	Matches known setup	Correct
Incorrect or Misleading Information
Claim	Reality	Issue
"mololink-app uses JWT"	Uses Passport.js sessions (13 passport references in auth.ts)	Incorrect
server/core/auth/ directory	Does not exist in this codebase	Fabricated
server/core/security/ directory	Does not exist	Fabricated
server/core/identity/ directory	Does not exist	Fabricated
client/src/pages/auth/ directory	Does not exist	Fabricated
server/api/auth/ directory	Does not exist	Fabricated
Database is molochaindb	Mololink uses mololinkdb (different name)	Incorrect
"Dual databases for users"	Not confirmed as issue for mololink	Unverified
Key Discrepancies
Authentication Method

External report claims: JWT-based for mololink
Reality: Session-based with Passport.js + Redis
Directory Structure

External report shows server/core/auth/, server/core/security/, etc.
Reality: These directories don't exist. Our auth is in server/auth.ts, server/middleware/auth.ts
Database Name

External report: molochaindb
Production mololink: mololinkdb
My Assessment
The external report appears to be partially fabricated or from a different version/branch of the codebase. The infrastructure information (containers, ports, subdomains) is accurate, but the codebase structure is completely wrong for this repository.

Possible explanations:

Report generated for a different codebase/branch
AI hallucination of directory structures
Mixed with documentation from admin-docker or another service
Recommendation: Use my report (docs/auth-system-report.md) for this codebase. The external report's infrastructure sections can be trusted, but ignore its codebase structure claims.
