Adding i18n support to auth components
Task
Implement comprehensive i18n for Login.tsx and enhance Register.tsx translations, including dynamic validation messages and updating all locale files.


Hide work done
5 minutes
I'll read the full Login.tsx and Register.tsx files, plus all 4 locale files to understand the current state and implement the i18n changes.

Now I understand the current state. Let me implement the i18n changes. I'll update both React components and all 4 translation files.

Now I need to update all 4 translation files with the new auth keys. Let me update them:

Let me read the Arabic file's auth section to see the exact content:

Now I have the exact content. Let me update all 3 remaining translation files:

Successfully implemented comprehensive i18n/translation support for Login.tsx and enhanced Register.tsx translations.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Login.tsx - Full i18n Implementation:**
   - Imported `useTranslation` from react-i18next
   - Replaced ALL hardcoded strings with `t()` calls using "auth.login" namespace:
     - NavBar: "Home", "Register" links
     - Card title: "Welcome Back" and description
     - Form labels: "Email Address", "Password"
     - Form placeholders: "Enter your email", "Enter your password"
     - Checkbox: "Remember me for 30 days"
     - Forgot password link
     - Login button states: "Sign In" / "Signing in..."
     - Register CTA: "New to MoloChain?", "Create an Account"
     - Terms of Service and Privacy Policy footer text
     - Toast messages for success/failure

2. **Register.tsx - Enhanced i18n:**
   - Created dynamic Zod schema factory `createFormSchema(t)` for translated validation messages
   - All validation errors now use translation keys (username length, format, email validation, password requirements)
   - Translated all form labels and placeholders
   - Card title and description with translations
   - Password hint text translated
   - Submit button states: "Create Account" / "Creating account..."
   - Toast messages: success title and description
   - Login link: "Already have an account?", "Sign In"
   - Security notice translated

3. **Translation Files Updated (all 4 locales):**
   - client/public/locales/en/translation.json
   - client/public/locales/ar/translation.json (Arabic)
   - client/public/locales/fa/translation.json (Farsi/Persian)
   - client/public/locales/tr/translation.json (Turkish)

   Added extensive keys under `auth.login` and `auth.register` namespaces including:
   - `nav.home`, `nav.register`
   - `toast.success`, `toast.welcomeBack`, `toast.failed`, `toast.error`, `toast.fillFields`
   - `validation.*` (11 validation message keys)
   - All form field labels, placeholders, and UI text

**Verification:**
- All 4 JSON files validated for correct syntax
- No TypeScript/LSP errors in either component
- Application running successfully with no errors
Result
Completed i18n support for Login.tsx and enhanced Register.tsx, translating all hardcoded strings, form labels, placeholders, and validation messages across four locale files.

Reviewing multilingual i18n implementation
The architect review found that ServiceDetailTemplate still has hardcoded strings. Let me fix that:
